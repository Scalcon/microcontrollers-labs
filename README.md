Each one of these projects were developed in Assembly, specifically for an ARM Cortex-M4 chip, using the Keil uVision5 IDE;

The board for debugging is a Texas Instruments Tiva TM4C1294XL (https://www.ti.com/tool/EK-TM4C1294XL);

For the GPIO projects, we used a TAB (Tiva Auxiliar Board), developed by the Electronics department of UTFPR and made available by our professor.
